## Features
   The M3TPlayer is a basic audio player to play MP3 files. We can manage a library and create playlists.

   To manage the music library, the user can change the file information, such as title, album name or artist. These actions does not change the files stored on the hard drive.
   
   In addition to these features, a rating system can also be used to classify music in order to your preference.

In top of that, you can read a radio stream from the Internet.
The management of the radio is modular, users can add radio stations in a simple way, by copying the stream links in the player. This permits the integration of web-radio, foreign or national radio stations.
